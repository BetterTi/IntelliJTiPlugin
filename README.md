# IntelliJTiPlugin

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide an open source development environment for the
Titanium Mobile SDK. I'm developing this plugin to support my own work on other projects. Intellij
will be the primary focus and then eclipse will follow.
 

## Status

Not ready yet. Hopefully a working version will be available July 4th.


## Planned Features

- Debugging on iOS Devices and Simulators
- Debugging on Android Devices and Simulator (trying to target Genymotion too)
- Intellij plugin is the first iteration
- Once intellij is stable, move to eclipse integration
- Gradle integration? (No research yet, that would be nice though).
